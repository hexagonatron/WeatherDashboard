## Goal

The goal for this assignment was to use the open weather API to create a weather dashboard where a user can view todays weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. I tried to create this dashboard in the neumorphic style. I have also used a media query so that the dashboard still looks acceptable on smaller screens.
